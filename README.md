# notebook-lid-scroll
Very budget style animation of a notebook lid move upon page scroll.

## [DEMO](https://adambertalan.github.io/notebook-lid-scroll/index.html)

I just wanted to try out this kind of way to create animations using flipbook like images.
The images are super super low quality and the lid movement was created with touchpad using [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/).

The more image you add, the smoother the image transition will be ofc. I only used 19 images.

The purpose of this example is for me to see how this concept works in practice!
